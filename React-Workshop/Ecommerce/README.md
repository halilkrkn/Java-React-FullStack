# React + Vite

 **Vite + React**

This project demonstrates how to use Vite to set up a development environment for a React application.

**Prerequisites**

To run this project, you will need the following:

* Node.js (version 16 or higher)
* npm (version 7 or higher)
* Vite (version 2 or higher)

**Installation**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

```
npm install
```

**Development**

To start the development server, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server on port 3000. The server will automatically rebuild the application whenever you make changes to the source code.

**Deployment**

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory containing the production-ready application.

**Code Overview**

The `App.jsx` file is the main component of the application. It contains the following code:

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
